# PocketBase Extension Plan with Golang

This plan outlines the steps to extend PocketBase v0.30.0 with custom Golang routes and learn the necessary concepts.

## Phase 1: Learning PocketBase Extension

1. **Study PocketBase Documentation**
   - Read the official PocketBase docs: https://pocketbase.io/docs/
   - Focus on Go extensions: https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-extensions/
   - Understand the core concepts: hooks, custom routes, middleware

2. **Learn Go Basics (if needed)**
   - Review Go syntax, structs, interfaces, and HTTP handling
   - Study PocketBase's Go API and event system
   - Watch tutorials on building custom PocketBase apps

3. **Understand PocketBase Architecture**
   - Learn about collections, records, and authentication
   - Study existing hooks and how to add custom logic
   - Review security best practices for extensions

## Phase 2: Setup Development Environment

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure Go 1.21+ is installed
   - Download PocketBase v0.30.0 source code
   - Set up a Go module for your extension

2. **Initialize Project**
   - Create a new Go file (e.g., main.go) in the back/ directory
   - Import PocketBase core packages
   - Set up basic PocketBase app instance

3. **Configure Development Server**
   - Add a script to run the extended PocketBase server
   - Test basic startup without custom code

## Phase 3: Implement Custom Routes

1. **Define Custom Endpoints**
   - Plan the API endpoints needed (e.g., /api/custom/notes, /api/custom/users)
   - Use PocketBase's router to add custom routes
   - Implement handlers for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

2. **Add Custom Logic**
   - Integrate with existing collections (notes, users)
   - Add validation, authentication checks
   - Implement business logic specific to your app

3. **Handle Authentication and Authorization**
   - Use PocketBase's auth system in custom routes
   - Add middleware for protected endpoints
   - Ensure secure data access

## Phase 4: Testing and Deployment

1. **Test Locally**
   - Run the extended server and test endpoints
   - Use tools like curl or Postman for API testing
   - Verify integration with frontend

2. **Add Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error responses
   - Add logging for debugging
   - Test edge cases and failures

3. **Build and Deploy**
   - Build the binary for production
   - Update Dockerfile if needed
   - Deploy to your environment

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 days (learning)
- Phase 2: 1 day (setup)
- Phase 3: 3-5 days (implementation, depending on complexity)
- Phase 4: 1-2 days (testing and deployment)

This plan will be updated as development progresses.
